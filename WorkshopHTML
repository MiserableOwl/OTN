Economics of Higher Ed - The Costs (4/15)
<p><img alt="Undergraduate Student Budget 18-19" src="https://libapps.s3.amazonaws.com/accounts/150004/images/udergraduate_budget.png" style="width: 960px; height: 398px;" /></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Graph source: <a href="https://trends.collegeboard.org/college-pricing/figures-tables/published-prices-national#Student%20Budgets,%202018-19" target="_blank">College Board &quot;Published Prices--National&quot;</a></strong></p>

<p><span style="font-size:16px;">The published price of tuition, fees, room and board, as well as books and supplies is often referred to as the &quot;sticker price&quot; for the school. Students who do not receive financial aid will pay the full sticker price to attend the college.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:16px;">The average &quot;sticker price&quot; for an institution is for one year of attendance. The total price for a degree will depend on how long a student takes to graduate. In a <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator_ctr.asp" target="_blank">2018 report on undergraduate retention and graduation rates from the National Center for Education Statistics</a>, &quot;60 percent of students who began seeking a Bachelor&#39;s degree at a 4-year institution in fall 2010 completed that degree within 6 years&quot;.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:16px;">From a <a href="http://nscresearchcenter.org/signaturereport9/#Introduction" target="_blank">report by the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center</a>, students who take 6 years to graduate spend 40% more than those who graduate in 4 years.&nbsp;</span></p>

Economics of Higher Ed - What can we Control? (5/15)
<p>Students face a mountain of expenses and responsibilities in order to succeed in college.The <a href="https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/pay-for-college/college-costs/college-costs-faqs" target="_blank">College Board</a>&nbsp;insists that college is not as expensive as one may think as long as research and consideration is done when choosing a college.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In preparation for college, students must prepare to set aside money or request financial aid for:&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Tuition and Fees</strong> - This fee may change depending on credit hours taken, in-state and out-of-state status, and the type of institution the student is attending.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Room and Board</strong> - Students may be charged for room and board when they choose to live on campus and can be considered an expense to anticipate. However, for commuter students, they must prepare to spend money on their own rent and living costs when they live off campus.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Books and Supplies</strong> - The College Board anticipates students average about $1,300 for books for a full academic year for students at a four-year university. Colleges like James Madison University and Richard Bland College anticipate costs for books below the College Board Average while colleges like Virginia Commonwealth University and The College of William &amp; Mary anticipate costs for books above the average.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Personal Expenses</strong> - Students must choose between maintaining their standard of living or altering it to fit within their college budget. Laundry, cell phone bills, food and entertainment are&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Transportation</strong> - No matter if they live on campus or off-campus, transportation is necessary for trips around the campus or home for the occasional visit. Students must be prepared to budget not only for gas, but potentially parking as well.&nbsp;</p>

Economics of the Textbook Industry - Introduction (6/15)
<p>In 2015&nbsp;this was the headline at NBC News:</p>

<h3><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/freshman-year/college-textbook-prices-have-risen-812-percent-1978-n399926" target="_blank"><strong>College Textbook Prices Have Risen 1,041 Percent Since 1977</strong></a></h3>

<p>&quot;According to NBC&#39;s review of Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data, textbook prices have risen over three times the rate of inflation from January 1977 to June 2015, a 1,041 percent increase.&quot;</p>

Economics of the Textbook Industry - Traditional Publishing Model (7/15)
<h3>Traditional Publishing Model</h3>

<p>In a traditional textbook publishing model, the publisher typically:</p>

<ul>
	<li>funds the textbook creation and production upfront&nbsp;and</li>
	<li>recoups costs and collects profits through sales</li>
</ul>

<p>The author typically:</p>

<ul>
	<li>is paid through royalties from sales and</li>
	<li>signs copyright over to publisher</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

Economics of the Textbook Industry - Alternative Publishing Model (8/15)
<h3>Alternative Publishing Model</h3>

<p>In an alternative publishing model, funding&nbsp;comes from a grant. The grantor typically:</p>

<ul>
	<li>funds the textbook creation and production upfront and</li>
	<li>requires an open license for publication</li>
</ul>

<p>The publisher typically:</p>

<ul>
	<li>is paid for services through the grant</li>
</ul>

<p>The author typically:</p>

<ul>
	<li>is paid for services&nbsp;through the grant and</li>
	<li>retains copyright under an open license</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="378" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/333118944" width="640"></iframe></p>

First Monday (18)1. Retrieved from https://journals.uic.edu/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/3972/3383</strong></p>

<p>Eight community colleges primarily serving at-risk students collaborated together on Project Kaleidoscope. Project Kaleidoscope is focused on the adoption of OER in the institution. Project Kaleidoscope affected 2,000 students divided among 40 teachers. A questionnaire was sent to faculty for students&#39; preparedness, experience teaching the course with the OER, and the perception of use compared to the previous texts. Students were also sent a questionnaire to identify typical amount of spending on textbooks, perception of OER quality, and likelihood of registering for other courses that use OER. 11 instructors responded to the survey and 132 students responded.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Instructors reported that there is a somewhat initial hidden cost to the adoption of an OER as they must adjust teaching style and strategy. 70 percent of instructors indicated that students used their OER textbook at least two-to-three times a week and 90 percent of instructors reported that students were equally prepared (60 percent) or more prepared (30 percent). All 11 instructors who responded said they would be very likely to use open texts in future courses.&nbsp;</p>

<p>64 percent of students reported using the OER textbook at least two-to-three times per week. 56 percent of students said the quality of the text was the same quality of texts in other courses and 41 percent stated the OER was better than the quality of texts in other courses. 77 percent reported they would be very likely or somewhat likely to register for a futrue course with online texts. 75 percent of students considered the OER text as being a positive experience.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The School of Business at Virginia State University (VSU) began to explore ways to improve the student experience around the course content. VSU identified Flat World Knowledge, a publisher of open textbooks, and partnered with them to give students in the business school access to the open textbook while also paying a fee to give students access to flash cards, quizzes, and videos for studying. The textbook was provided to students in PDF, Kindle reader, MP3, and other electronic formats. Students who registered for a Flat World Knowledge license were invited to take a survey at the end of every semester. Over 90 percent of respondents considered the textbook easy to both use and read. About 70 percent of students agreed that the portability of the Flat World Knowledge digital content was more preferable to traditional textbooks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At a small public college, 23 students from two upper-level psychology courses were asked to read two passages about a fictional &quot;Dr. Wilson&quot;. In one passage, Dr. Wilson used a traditional textbook and in another passage Dr. Wilson used an open textbook and they were rated on many characteristics: kindness, knowledgeability, enthusiasm, patience, encouragement, and creativity. Students were also requested to provided justification for their responses. Students justified an open, or cheaper, textbook alternative as being the reason they rated &quot;Dr. Wilson&quot; as being kinder and more creative--with students also using this justification for signing up for more classes with the professor that provided the open alternative. Although there were responses that stated that the passage did not adequately support &quot;Dr. Wilson&#39;s&quot; kindness and patience, there is a mental justification among the small population that low-cost alternatives provided by the professor made them nicer and more supportive.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:16px;">The ChemWiki is an open resource from the Hyperlibrary project. The Hyperlibrary was initiated by the University of California, Davis to reduce the growing educational cost of STEM fields. The ChemWiki was evaluated in a pilot of two classes that used the Wiki and one class that used the commercial textbook. A survey was given to all students to identify online versus textbook access and their opinions. Grades and study performance was also evaluated. Results showed that classes that both performed equally well and had the same normalized learning gains. While this may show that OER do not improve the grades or study habits of the student, it does demonstrate that students perform equally well compared to their cohorts using the traditional textbook.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:16px;">In a study from Northern Virginia Community College system, 146 students were enrolled in an 8-week&nbsp;section of a history class. Three sections utilized OER and three did not. There was a moderate positive correlation between OER versus non-OER and student achievement. This result shows that there is a moderately positive relationship between taking an OER course and academic achievement.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:16px;">At Mercy College, The Project Kaleidoscope Open Course Initiative (KOCI) was initiated to target critical reading and math competencies in collaboration with other institutions. Course modules and outlines were created with faculty teaching classes to a total of 600 students. Mercy faculty reported nearly 10 percent reduction in course failures in the first semester of using KOCI. Success rates for reading and persistence increased in sections in which KOCI was used. Algebra courses dropped their previously used licenses and costly math books and resources, saving students a total of $125,000 in the first year. At the end of the pilot, Mercy&#39;s Math Department announced that all sections in basic mathematics would use KOCI.&nbsp;</span></p>
